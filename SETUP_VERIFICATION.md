# Peer-Connect Setup Verification

## ✅ Configuration Status

### Environment Variables
- ✅ **Server `.env`**: Configured with Neon database and OpenAI API key
- ✅ **Client `.env`**: Configured with API URLs and OpenAI API key

### Dependencies
- ✅ **Root**: concurrently installed
- ✅ **Client**: React, React-DOM, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Socket.IO client, QR code library
- ✅ **Server**: Express, Socket.IO, PostgreSQL (Neon), JWT, Bcrypt

### Configuration Files
- ✅ **Vite Config**: Properly configured with React plugin
- ✅ **PostCSS Config**: Using @tailwindcss/postcss
- ✅ **Tailwind Config**: Configured for client source files
- ✅ **Netlify Config**: Ready for deployment

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Run Both Client and Server Together
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Run Separately

**Terminal 1 - Server:**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Client:**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Access Points

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Network Access**: http://192.168.1.99:5173 (from other devices on your network)

## 📋 Pre-Flight Checklist

### Database Setup
- ✅ Neon PostgreSQL database URL configured
- ✅ Database tables will auto-create on first server start
- ✅ Tables: `users`, `contacts`

### API Keys
- ✅ OpenAI API key configured in both client and server
- ✅ JWT secret configured for authentication

### Features Ready
- ✅ User registration and login
- ✅ Contact management (search, request, accept/reject)
- ✅ WebRTC video calling
- ✅ Real-time translation with OpenAI Realtime API
- ✅ Live subtitle rendering
- ✅ QR code generation for contact sharing
- ✅ Online/offline status tracking

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### 1. Test Authentication
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Create a new account
4. Verify you're redirected to the dashboard

### 2. Test Contact Management
1. Click "Add Contact" tab
2. Search for a username
3. Send a contact request
4. (Use another account to accept the request)

### 3. Test Video Call
1. Ensure you have at least one accepted contact
2. Contact must be online (green indicator)
3. Click "Call" button
4. Accept the call on the other end
5. Test video, audio, and translation features

### 4. Test Translation
1. During an active call
2. Select a target language from the dropdown
3. Speak into your microphone
4. Verify subtitles appear at the bottom of the video

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Check DATABASE_URL is valid
- Ensure port 3001 is not in use
- Verify all server dependencies are installed

### Client Won't Start
- Ensure port 5173 is not in use
- Check all client dependencies are installed
- Verify Vite config is correct

### Translation Not Working
- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is valid and has Realtime API access
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted

### Video/Audio Issues
- Grant browser permissions for camera and microphone
- Check WebRTC connection in browser console
- Verify both users are online

## 📊 System Requirements

### Development
- Node.js 18+
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Microphone and camera for video calls
- Stable internet connection

### Production
- HTTPS required for WebRTC
- PostgreSQL database (Neon recommended)
- OpenAI API account with Realtime API access

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test locally**: Run both servers and test all features
2. **Deploy backend**: Use Railway, Render, or similar
3. **Deploy frontend**: Push to GitHub and connect to Netlify
4. **Update URLs**: Change API URLs in production .env files
5. **Test production**: Verify all features work in production

## 📝 Important Notes

- The database schema auto-creates on first server start
- WebRTC requires HTTPS in production (works on localhost for dev)
- OpenAI Realtime API has usage costs - monitor your usage
- Contact requests must be accepted before calling
- Both users must be online to make a call
